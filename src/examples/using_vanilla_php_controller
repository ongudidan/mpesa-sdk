Let me guide you step-by-step on how to use the **vanilla PHP M-Pesa class** I provided earlier. This process assumes that you have basic knowledge of PHP, and you'll be using **vanilla PHP** without any frameworks like Laravel or Yii2.

### Steps to Use the Vanilla PHP M-Pesa Class:

#### 1. **Install Dependencies** (Optional):
If you're using a package that requires Composer, such as the **M-Pesa SDK**, you can install it via Composer. If you don’t have Composer installed yet, follow [this link to install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you're using a library like `Mpesa`, you should first install it using:

```bash
composer require mpesa/mpesa-sdk
```

But if you don’t want to use Composer and just want to copy the code I provided, you can ignore this step.

#### 2. **Create a New PHP File (e.g., `MpesaController.php`)**:
Create a new PHP file where you'll put the M-Pesa controller class. For example, `MpesaController.php` or whatever you prefer.

```php
// MpesaController.php

<?php

// Include the Mpesa SDK
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

class MpesaController {

    private $mpesa;

    public function __construct() {
        // Initialize Mpesa SDK
        $this->mpesa = new \Mpesa\Mpesa();
    }

    // Define the actions such as B2C, C2B, STK Push etc.
    public function b2c() {
        $data = [
            'Initiator' => 'API user created on Safaricom Business dashboard',
            'InitiatorPassword' => 'Password of the API user',
            'CommandID' => 'BusinessPayment', // or SalaryPayment, PromotionPayment
            'Amount' => '100', // Amount to send
            'PartyA' => '600XXX', // Your shortcode
            'PartyB' => '2547XXXXXXXX', // Customer phone number
            'Remarks' => 'Salary payment',
            'QueueTimeOutURL' => 'https://yourdomain.com/timeout',
            'ResultURL' => 'https://yourdomain.com/result',
            'Occasion' => 'JunePayroll',
            'environment' => 'sandbox',
            'consumer_key' => 'your_consumer_key',
            'consumer_secret' => 'your_consumer_secret',
        ];

        $response = $this->mpesa->b2c($data);
        echo json_encode($response);
    }

    // Similar methods for accountBalance, c2b, reversal, etc. (as I defined earlier)
}
?>
```

#### 3. **Create a Front Controller to Trigger Actions**:

You need a front controller or a simple script that triggers the actions defined in `MpesaController.php`.

Example file: `index.php`

```php
<?php

// Include the MpesaController
require_once 'MpesaController.php';

// Initialize the MpesaController class
$mpesaController = new MpesaController();

// Call the desired action (for example, B2C)
$mpesaController->b2c(); // You can replace this with other methods like $mpesaController->stkPush() etc.
?>
```

#### 4. **Set Up Your Local or Online PHP Server**:
You can test your PHP scripts on your local machine or an online web hosting service.

- **For Local Development:**
  If you have PHP installed, you can use the built-in PHP server to test it locally:

  ```bash
  php -S localhost:8000
  ```

  This will start a local PHP server at `http://localhost:8000`. Now, visit `http://localhost:8000/index.php` in your browser to test the action.

- **For Live Server:**
  Simply upload both `MpesaController.php` and `index.php` to your hosting provider (via FTP or cPanel File Manager) and visit the corresponding URL (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/index.php`).

#### 5. **Configure M-Pesa API Credentials:**
Before using any of the actions, ensure you have the following credentials from **Safaricom's Business API**:
  - **Consumer Key**
  - **Consumer Secret**
  - **Shortcode**
  - **Passkey** (for STK Push)
  - **Initiator Password** (for B2C, B2B, and other transactions)

You can replace placeholders like `your_consumer_key`, `your_consumer_secret`, and `600XXX` with your actual credentials in the class and functions.

#### 6. **Testing the M-Pesa API**:
To test if everything works:
- Visit the page `index.php` in your browser.
- This will call the desired action, such as `b2c()`, and return a response from the M-Pesa API.

The response will be in JSON format, for example:
```json
{
  "ResponseCode": "0",
  "ResponseDescription": "Success",
  "TransactionID": "OEI2AK4Q16"
}
```

#### 7. **Handle Responses and Errors**:
In the controller methods, you can handle success and failure cases.

For example:
```php
public function b2c() {
    // Your B2C request data here...
    $response = $this->mpesa->b2c($data);

    if ($response['ResponseCode'] == '0') {
        // Transaction was successful
        echo "Payment successful!";
    } else {
        // Transaction failed
        echo "Payment failed. Error: " . $response['ResponseDescription'];
    }
}
```

### 8. **M-Pesa Callback**:
Once you trigger transactions like STK Push or C2B, the M-Pesa API will send a callback to the **Confirmation URL** or **Validation URL** you provided. You can create PHP scripts to handle those callbacks.

Example callback handler (`confirmation.php`):

```php
<?php

// Receive the data from M-Pesa Callback
$callbackData = file_get_contents('php://input');

// Parse the data or log it
file_put_contents('mpesa_callback.log', $callbackData);

// You can process the callback data here, like checking payment status, etc.
echo "Callback received.";
?>
```

This will be used to receive and process callback notifications from M-Pesa.

### Conclusion:
1. **Set up the `MpesaController.php` with all the API methods** (e.g., `b2c()`, `stkPush()`, etc.).
2. **Use the `index.php` to trigger the actions** from the controller.
3. **Set up your credentials** to connect with the M-Pesa API (consumer key, secret, shortcode, etc.).
4. **Test** your application on your local server or live hosting.
5. **Handle responses** appropriately and configure the callback URLs.

With this setup, you can easily call the M-Pesa API for various operations in your PHP application.
